            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the development log for my Game Boy emulator project! 
                This project is a journey into understanding how the classic Game Boy hardware works 
                by building a cycle-accurate emulator in C++.
            </p>

            <h3>Project Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Build a fully functional Game Boy emulator from scratch</li>
                <li>Learn about CPU architecture, memory management, and hardware emulation</li>
                <li>Document the development process for others to learn from</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What You Need to Write an Emulator</h3>
            <p>
                The topics related to emulation can go quite deep, but to start with simple systems 
                all you really need is some basic computer architecture knowledge, documentation and a 
                somewhat fast programming language.
            </p>

            <h4>Computer Architecture</h4>
            <p>
                I will probably cover some things when absolutely necessary, but the gist of it is 
                knowing a bit of how a CPU works. Things like how registers store data, how instructions 
                are fetched and executed, and how memory is addressed.
            </p>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <p>
                The best documentation on Game Boy is the <a href="https://gbdev.io/pandocs/" target="_blank">pandocs</a>. 
                If you get stuck, looking at other emulator implementations can help you understand different 
                approaches to solving problems.
            </p>

            <h4>Programming Language</h4>
            <p>
                The older the system is the more leeway you have with the programming language speed. 
                I also prefer programming languages that allow you to use unsigned integers as that 
                better represents what the hardware is capable of.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's say you have a 16-bit address space, this would mean addresses from 0 to 65,535, 
                which is the maximum value of an unsigned 16-bit integer, as opposed to a range of 
                -32,768 to 32,767. You can just use a 32-bit integer to access the values, but I think 
                it's a bit easier with unsigned integers.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this project I will be using <strong>C++</strong>, with a disclaimer that I'm not a C++ 
                programmer and my code might end up not being idiomatic. Plain old C is a perfect language 
                for this kind of project but I want to learn C++ at some point as most modern emulators 
                are written in it, so I might as well use it.
            </p>

            <h3>Development Timeline</h3>

                <li><strong>Phase 5:</strong> PPU Rendering - Background, window, and sprite layers ✓</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 6:</strong> Input System - Keyboard and gamepad support ✓</li>

                <li><strong>Phase 10:</strong> MBCs - Memory bank controllers for larger ROMs (Planned)</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 11:</strong> Serial - Link cable communication (Planned)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Current Status</h3>
            <p>
                The emulator currently features a CPU with many core instructions implemented, 
                complete PPU with all three rendering layers (background, window, sprites), and dual input 
                support (keyboard + gamepad). It successfully runs games like Tetris for over 6 million cycles 
                before hitting unimplemented instructions.
            </p>
